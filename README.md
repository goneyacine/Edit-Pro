# EditPro

## Introduction 

EditPro is an open-source photo editing software written in C++, my goal with this project is to learn about image processing and qt framework and share the knowledge I get from this journey with the world to provide people with more resources to learn about image processing.

## What You'll Get From This Project ? 

I'll be documenting everything I learn about image processing and share it, and I'll be sharing with you all the resources I've used to make it easier for everyone who wants to learn image processing.

## How Can You Help ? 

well, this is an open-source project, so you help us by fixing bugs, adding new features, adding documentation, writing tutorials...

for now I haven't setup a contribution guide (I'll do it soon) but If you're intrested in helping us just DM me on twitter (@Yacine_Betouche)
